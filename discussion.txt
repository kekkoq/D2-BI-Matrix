    Why do YOU think being able to determine the most popular activity and tool from this discussion could be a valuable skill for business intelligence specialists? Having the ability to take data out of a source and analyze it is a skill that is necessary for BI specialists. By having these skills a BI specialist would be able to review the data and recommend ways to improve how a business can improve.
    How might you go about it? Describe your process: Currently, since I am not familiar with these tools except for excel, I will go through the posts and read them to see what others have stated.
    Estimate the most popular activities selected: Data Visualization and Data Analysis.
    Tell us how you arrived at this answer: I went through the posts and reviewed them. I kept track of what was said.
    Estimate the most popular tool to learn: Power BI.
    Tell us how you arrived at this answer: Same as the activities, I went through all of the posts, read and kept track of what the answers were. Reading through other responses though, I hope to learn how to take the data from our discussion board and upload it as others have.

    Why do YOU think being able to determine the most popular activity and tool from this discussion could be a valuable skill for business intelligence specialists? Understanding what the most popular activity or tool may help someone understand where the biggest problem lie in a business or what would make the most sense to learn to use. If many people chose that they want to learn about powerBI, they likely have a need to visualize their data. 
    How might you go about it? Describe your process: I would make a table to start listing the tools and activities. Then I would add a row with the count of the activity or tool. 
    Estimate the most popular activities selected: Data Visualization
    Tell us how you arrived at this answer: I scrolled through the responses. Data visualization appeared to occur frequently. Data analysis appeared to occurred slightly less often. 
    Estimate the most popular tool to learn: PowerBI
    Tell us how you arrived at this answer: I scrolled through all of the responses and kept a count of how often the tool was mentioned.

    Tool YOU want to learn: I want to learn about all of them but choosing one, I’d pick Tableau.
    Why does this tool appeal to YOU for business intelligence.  I’ve been working on my own dashboard to present information and want to know if it would be something I could utilize.
    Tool YOU don't want to learn now: Again, I want to learn about everything but having to pick one, I’d say Apache Spark.
    Why does this tool not seem as important for YOU to learn right now: I don’t know that its something I need to learn or anything I could use.

    Why do YOU think being able to determine the most popular activity and tool from this discussion could be a valuable skill for business intelligence specialists? I think collecting any data is a valuable skill. Data can be used to make business decisions and provide reasoning and help predict future business operations. This data can help a business decide how to prioritize training based on feedback.
    How might you go about it? Describe your process: With my current limited experience, I would copy all the data into a spread sheet and clean it up by removing blank spaces, dates, unnecessary words, and correcting formatting so it would be easy to analyze and view. 
    Estimate the most popular activities selected: At the time of this post there the top 3 most popular activities are Data Analysis, Data Visualization, and Data Cleaning.
    Tell us how you arrived at this answer: I copied a list of the tools into excel. Went through the submissions and added 1 by every tool and took the sum. 11 for top 2 and 10 for the other. 
    Estimate the most popular tool to learn: It's a tie between Data Visualization and Data Analysis. 
    Tell us how you arrived at this answer: See answer to 5!

    Why do YOU think being able to determine the most popular activity and tool from this discussion could be a valuable skill for business intelligence specialists? I think this is valuable because business intelligence specialists often need to identify trends and preferences in large sets of data. Knowing what activities or tools are most popular helps decision-makers understand user behavior, allocate resources better, and focus on the most relevant solutions. It is a fundamental skill to move from raw data to actionable insights.
    How might you go about it? Describe your process:     My process was:                                                                                                                                         1 - I copied the Canvas discussion text into a plain file (discussion.txt).                                                                                                                                       2 -I used my Python parser (parse_canvas_discussion.py) to clean and transform the discussion into a structured CSV file.                                           3 - I imported the CSV into a Jupyter Notebook and used pandas to count the frequency of each activity and tool.                                                       4 - Finally, I created bar charts with matplotlib to visualize which activities and tools were selected the most.
    Estimate the most popular activities selected: Data visualization
    Tell us how you arrived at this answer: I ran the CSV through pandas.value_counts() to count how many times each activity appeared. Then I sorted the results to see which activity had the highest count. I also double-checked the result with a bar chart.
    Estimate the most popular tool to learn: Power Bi and Apache Spark
    Tell us how you arrived at this answer: I followed the same process as with the activities: I counted the frequency of each tool using pandas.value_counts() and confirmed the result visually in a chart.

 

 

I uploaded my full project on GitHub, where I built a Canvas Discussion Analyzer.

    Why do YOU think being able to determine the most popular activity and tool from this discussion could be a valuable skill for business intelligence specialists? It would help BI specialist by letting them know what is popular and what most data analysts are using. It helps them to know what to look for and what to expect when they are collaborating with data analysts. 
    How might you go about it? Describe your process: I would tally what people’s responses were for their first preferred activity, and then for every preferred activity. I would then be able to see which one had the highest and lowest number of choices. 
    Estimate the most popular activities selected: Data Analysis & Data Visualization
    Tell us how you arrived at this answer: I looked through all of the part 1 posts and at least one of those two was in the top 3 for all but two people 
    Estimate the most popular tool to learn: Power BI with Apache Spark close behind
    Tell us how you arrived at this answer: I scrolled through the part 1 responses and noted the ones that I saw the most. I will say that even though I came up with a most popular tool, I did feel as though the responses were pretty varied.

    Tool YOU want to learn: Python, Looker and Spark
    Why does this tool appeal to YOU for business intelligence: I need to learn more about Python because there are opportunities to use it at work, but as a beginner, I’m still learning how to apply it or identify use cases. I also noticed that Looker is increasingly listed as a required skill in analyst job postings. Knowing Apache Spark is valuable if I have to handle large-scale data.
    Tool YOU don't want to learn now: Shiny
    Why does this tool not seem as important for YOU to learn right now: Shiny appears to be commonly used in academic and government settings, which is not my current work environment. Since Shiny is built on R and I don’t have experience with R, it would make more sense to learn the language first before diving into Shiny.

    Why do YOU think being able to determine the most popular activity and tool from this discussion could be a valuable skill for business intelligence specialists? You can learn tools that are "low key", that not many data analytics know, and differentiate and set yourself apart from the rest of the field.
    How might you go about it? Describe your process: I can either do a brief skim and estimate the most popular, or I can simply count the totals for a definite answer. 
    Estimate the most popular activities selected: Data transformation, analysis, and visualization.
    Tell us how you arrived at this answer: I arrived at this consensus by skimming through the discussion thread and finding the most common answers.
    Estimate the most popular tool to learn: Power BI
    Tell us how you arrived at this answer: I skimmed through, and Power BI was by far the most popular answer.

    Tool YOU want to learn: Power BI
    Why does this tool appeal to YOU for business intelligence: Power BI is appealing to me because of its integration and ease of use. Alongside Python and Tableau Power BI, it is the most popular analysis tool I have heard of amongst people in the data analytics field. 
    Tool YOU don't want to learn now: I just finished learning about Tableau. I have previous coursework experience with Python and Sequel, so I would be okay learning other tools besides these, unless I learn advanced skills and how those listed tools integrate within the bigger picture.
    Why does this tool not seem as important for YOU to learn right now: These tools are not as important as I already have foundational knowledge and need advanced, hands-on, real work experience to grow, or else it would be redundant information.

    Why do YOU think being able to determine the most popular activity and tool from this discussion could be a valuable skill for business intelligence specialists? It shows how BI specialists can find patterns and trends in written information. It’s just like using data to figure out what people or companies focus on most.
    How might you go about it? Describe your process: Tally up everyone's answer (top 3 activities and tool) and then see which one show up the most. 
    Estimate the most popular activities selected: Data Visualization and Data Cleaning 
    Tell us how you arrived at this answer:  Data Visualization was listed first or second, and Data Cleaning came up a lot too since you have to clean data before using it.
    Estimate the most popular tool to learn: Power BI 
    Tell us how you arrived at this answer: Power BI was mentioned the most (so far) across everyone's post.

SUBMISSON 1 

    Your preferred name: Tiffany 
    Your preferred activity 1: Data Visualization 
    Your preferred activity 2: Data Transformation
    Your preferred activity 3: Data Analysis 
    Tool YOU want to learn: Power BI ( I am picking that over Tableau only because I have gotten introductory exposure to Tableau) and logically it make sense to learn the program you have the possibility of using every day. 
    Why does this tool appeal to YOU for business intelligence: Power BI appeals to me because of its strong integration with Microsoft products and its ability to turn raw data into interactive dashboards and clear visual stories. As someone working in healthcare authorization management, I see its potential to simplify reporting, highlight performance trends, and support faster data-driven decision-making. The intuitive design also makes it a powerful bridge between technical and non-technical users, which is essential in collaborative healthcare environments.
    Tool YOU don't want to learn now: Apache Spark
    Why does this tool not seem as important for YOU to learn right now: While Apache Spark is incredibly powerful for large-scale and real-time data processing, it feels a bit beyond my immediate scope.

    Why do YOU think being able to determine the most popular activity and tool from this discussion could be a valuable skill for business intelligence specialists? Because it mirrors real BI work, turning unstructured text into structured insight. Spotting which skills and tools dominate helps prioritize training, hiring, and tech stack decisions. 
    How might you go about it? Describe your process:   

        Collect all posts into a table (Name, Activities 1–3, Tool-to-learn).

        Normalize synonyms (e.g., “dashboard creation” → data visualization; “predictive analytics” → machine learning).

        Count frequencies of activities and tools.

        (Optional) Visualize with a simple bar chart.

        Document assumptions (ties, multi-tool answers).
    Estimate the most popular activities selected: Data Viz
    Tell us how you arrived at this answer: So far the posts listed, “data visualization” appears in 9 entries. “Data cleaning” and “data analysis” each appear in 6 entries.
    Estimate the most popular tool to learn: Tie between Power BI and Spark
    Tell us how you arrived at this answer: Counting explicit “Tool YOU want to learn” responses: Power BI (5), Apache Spark (5), Tableau (3), Python (2). One post listed “Power BI or Tableau,” which I counted for both. Normalized “Spark” → “Apache Spark.”

    Why do YOU think being able to determine the most popular activity and tool from this discussion could be a valuable skill for business intelligence specialists? This is valuable because it reflects a core part of what BI specialists do — analyzing unstructured data to uncover trends and insights. Being able to identify which tools or activities are gaining the most attention helps professionals and organizations stay aligned with current industry standards and skill demands. It’s essentially turning qualitative discussion data into actionable business intelligence.
    How might you go about it? Describe your process: I would gather all responses from the discussion into one document or spreadsheet. Then, I’d perform a keyword frequency analysis to count how often each activity and tool is mentioned. Tools like Python (using pandas and word frequency scripts) or Power BI could help visualize these trends. I might also look for patterns manually, grouping similar phrases (like “data visualization” and “dashboard creation”) to make the insights more accurate.
    Estimate the most popular activities selected: Data Cleaning and Data Visualization
    Tell us how you arrived at this answer: Many classmates emphasize data cleaning because messy data is one of the biggest challenges in real-world BI work. Data visualization also comes up often since it’s what makes insights understandable and shareable. These two activities are usually top priorities in both academic and professional BI projects.
    Estimate the most popular tool to learn: Power BI
    Tell us how you arrived at this answer: After reviewing multiple posts, Power BI appears to be the most frequently mentioned tool. It’s popular because it integrates smoothly with other Microsoft products and is widely used across organizations. Even though I personally want to learn Tableau, I can see why Power BI stands out as the most common choice among classmates.

    Tool YOU want to learn: Tableau
    Why does this tool appeal to YOU for business intelligence: Tableau appeals to me because it combines powerful visual analytics with user-friendly design. I like that it can connect directly to a wide range of data sources and that it’s highly interactive — making it easier to tell meaningful stories with data. In business contexts, visual communication often determines whether insights are acted upon, and Tableau helps bridge that gap. I’ve also noticed many employers value Tableau skills, which makes learning it professionally beneficial.
    Tool YOU don't want to learn now: Qlik Sense
    Why does this tool not seem as important for YOU to learn right now: While Qlik Sense is a solid BI tool, it’s less common in the environments I’m most interested in. Many organizations I’ve seen use Tableau or Power BI instead, so I’d rather focus my time on tools that align with those systems. Once I’m more comfortable with the mainstream BI platforms, I might explore Qlik later to expand my toolkit.

    Why do YOU think being able to determine the most popular activity and tool from this discussion could be a valuable skill for business intelligence specialists? Being able to determine the most popular activity and from this discussion could give insight or different perspective to what tools may be more widely used and what skills that may be more valued in the field.
    How might you go about it? Describe your process: Keep up to date with growing tools (Examples: Google Looker or Metabase), as well as researching what skills are being actively requested in relating positions. An example could be as looking for data of job listings and the required/preferred skills. Then, run a count of each instance. I actually did this for the final project in Data Visualization.
    Estimate the most popular activities selected: Data Cleaning
    Tell us how you arrived at this answer: I'm not quite sure if this is the most "Popular", but data cleaning is the most extensive and ongoing process of the activities. As well as the current climate of companies and relation to data bases is there is a lot of data but its messy, really messy.
    Estimate the most popular tool to learn: Power Bi or Apache Spark
    Tell us how you arrived at this answer: Reviewed the current responses, as well as from my experience several companies already have transitioned their reporting toward Power BI, and a good amount of jobs posting have Apache Spark as a requested skill.
